<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>#7 - Source array was not long enough. Check srcIndex and length, and the array's lower bounds</strong> - Added logic to prevent Hotcakes view engine from being added to the collection multiple times. This logic addresses a memory leak and a race condition which can cause a site to crash. https://github.com/HotcakesCommerce/core/issues/7</li>
