	<h1>Hotcakes Commerce: Version 03.03.00</h1>
	
	<p><span class="muy-importante">IMPORTANT!</span> Please read through all of these release notes before proceeding. This is a major release with several improvements and maintenance updates that you need to be aware of.</p>
	<p>This is not your normal <em>Yada, yada...</em>.</p>
	
	<h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Tested for DNN 9.2+ and DNN 9.6+</strong> - Hotcakes was already working fine in DNN 9.2+, but there were a handful of leftover &quot;features&quot; that had to be removed to improve the DNN 9+ user experience. There were no updates required for actual compatiblity.</li>
		<li><strong>Removed Telerik</strong> - This solution has included Telerik since long before it was ever called Hotcakes Commerce. During this development cycle, we spent nearly 80 hours removing the Telerik controls to improve the security of Hotcakes as well as compatibility for DNN 9.6+. Nearly every single view had one of more Telerik controls included.</li>
		<li><strong>Raised DNN Version</strong> - Hotcakes Commerce (CMS) now ships only on DNN 9.6.1.</li>
		<li><strong>Raised Minimum Required DNN Version</strong> - Hotcakes Commerce (core) now requires DNN 9.2.2 or newer.</li>
		<li><strong>Improved First-Time Out-of-the-Box Experience</strong> - This refers to several updates, but most notably, the default theme, viewset, and page templates used for new installations of Hotcakes Commerce.</li>
		<li><strong>Numerous Security Hardening &amp; Performance Updates</strong> - Except for Telerik, there weren't any known security issues, but we found and applied several security updates during this development cycle. We also found and applied performance updates in several areas as part of our code review process.</li>
		<li><strong>Updated All Client-Side Scripts/Libraries</strong> - This solution requires various client-side JavaScript and related libraries and plugins. Each has been updated to their most recent version or replaced with an alternative.</li>
		<li><strong>Improved Store Administration</strong> - Authorized store managers can now navigate directly to their respective admin pages directly from the store front-end.</li>
		<li><strong>Localization Updates</strong> - During this development cycle, we updated every view that we came across that didn't already have localization applied to it.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Breaking Changes &amp; Other Important Considerations</h3>
	<p>As always, please <span class="muy-importante">backup before installing</span> any new/updated extension in your website and test in a development environment first.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="muy-importante">*</span>New Viewsets: You shouldn't be modifying the <em>_default</em> viewset. If you are, you should make a copy of it before installing this update. It's completely re-written and replaced by a Bootstrap 3 viewset. The standard Hotcakes viewset is added for backwards compatibility and edge cases, named <em>_default-Legacy</em>.</li>
		<li><span class="muy-importante">**</span><a href="https://github.com/HotcakesCommerce/hotcakes-commerce-core/issues/252" target="_blank">Issue 252</a>: Allowing any end-user to upload files alway presents risk for your website. Please plan for this and protect yourself accordingly.</li>
		<li><span class="muy-importante">***</span>If you are using one of the Hotcakes Commerce extension points or otherwise are integrating with it, you should review your source code builds for any warnings/errors before attempting any upgrade. Many deprecated endpoints have been removed and some others have been deprecated.</li>
		<li>Related to <a href="https://github.com/HotcakesCommerce/hotcakes-commerce-core/issues/44" target="_blank">Issue 44</a>, please review the new scheduled job and adjust it as desired.</li>
		<li>The ability to show the full credit card number (configuration option) has been removed.</li>
		<li>If upgrading to/past DNN 9.2.xx, you can upgrade Hotcakes before or after. This also applies to DNN 9.6+.</li>
